						<h2>AdhereSense is business sense meets health sense</h2>
						<p>AdhereSense seeks to unify the world of preventative health, employee initiatives, better work force, better play force, and better individuals.  We do this by combining three business segments that already have similar goals in mind:  healthier people. </p>
						<p>Healthly living, healthy eating, health visits:  many of our healthy-living efforts are fragmented.  AdhereSense seeks to alow the various efforts to be unified, whether by companies pursuing the health of their employees, companies that exist to promotoe health, companies that help sustain health living, and, most importantly,  individuals who need to be encouraged to health.  And that's all of us.  </p>

										<h3>Sponsor</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This starts it all off.  Many companies pursue health initiatives, spending real money to get a healthier, more resilient work force (not to mention the social aspect).  We work harder and better if we are healthy.  Enter AdhereSense with a pre-fabricated framework for rewarding and tracking health initiatives.  How are we different?  We offer a network of validation efforts that are simply plug-and-play. </p>

										<h3>Validator</h3>
									</header>
									<p>These are already out there.  Techno gadgets can trace your steps.  An app can know how long you were at the gym.  Other technology offers manual input for health-related efforts.  (And some things we are pursuing, we can't say).  Validators are simply a trusted way of knowing that the healthy efforts that are requested or tracked are accomplished.  Oh yeah, they can also pass on rewards.</p>

										<h3>Redeemer</h3>
									</header>
									<p>These exist, but don't know they are out there.  Many companies that are not solely health-driven are certainly interested in participating in healthy efforts.  They spend lots of money on advertising and awareness to let others know they are doing their part.  Enter AdhereSense.  With a certification for companies who are pursuing healthy-living, we can combine marketing efforts across many lines of business.  Become a certified AdhereSense Healthy Redeemer today.

						<h2>Why the BlockChain</h2>
						<p>Easy enough.  We think that healthy efforts should be noticed.  And improved.  And reinvented.  The blockchain technology has opened a world up where sharing information can make us stronger and smarter.  Smart contracts will allow employers to create initiatives and awards for inviduals.  Validators will gain visibility and rewards for fulfilling those iniatives.  Redeemers will be the final stop where all those healthy awards and rewards can be claimed --- healthyily, of course.  The blockchain will provide a transparent view of intiatives, demographic overview for a constant feedback loop, and a place where all efforts healthy can be seen.  And all of this while keeping the individual anonymous.  But, hey, you can share if you want to!</p>

									<h3>Healthy Living Starts with Movement</h3>
									<p>Whether its hiking, playing a game, or tracking yourself from point A to point B, it all starts with movement.  You move towards healthy living.  You move towards incentivizing, inspiring, and leading others to do so.  Your example, your initiative gets everything moving.  Happier, healthier individuals means a better work place, a better after work place, and better movement in-between. 
									<p>We're building our software, our websites, our apps.  We're delving into all the ways that make good business sense out of good health sense.  We looking to motivate.  We're creating our ledger, our blockchain, our tokens.</p>
									<p>We're moving.  Are you?</p>

						<p>Its easy to move on with us.  Simply drop us a note at the bottom of this page with a question, a suggestion, or anything you feel might help.  We'd love to continue expanding our network with people, with companies who are interested in healthly living. The more participants, the stronger the draw, the encouragement, the incentive.</p>

								<h3>Nuts and Bolts or The Grass and the Weeds</h3>
								<p>We're bootstrapping this whole thing ourselves, as of right now.  Several developers and a vast network of advisors, confidants, friends, subject matter experts, legal stuff, nights and weekends.  As we build out our software, marketing, and corporate contacts, we're designing a micro-licensing platform for our distributed ledger (think blockchain).  We're planning on driving the ledger by tokens and create a self-sustaining model.  </p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>To that end, you can help us by asking about our token model and participating in a pre-public distribution of the tokens.  For the technically saavy, we're intending an ethereum-like erc20 token model for our licensing and our initial funding.  For the non-technical, its basically a way of ensuring that companies using the network will be able to buy licensing from a pool and that those who hold the licenses can participate in a distribution model.  Ask to be 'white-listed', if you'd like more information about this piece of the puzzle.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrow)">
								<p>We're also looking for Stage 1 Sponsor participants.  These would be companies (for now) that would like to invest in a trial run of AdhereSense.  We're looking for companies are willing to put time into their employee's health by participating in preventative health via professional visits, incentive-based healthy habits, ad-hoc company ideas, and medical adherence.  We plan to accomplish these pieces by the buildout of our various software platforms (hyperledger blockchain, mobile application, administrative website).  Please let us know if you would like to help us expand our network and are willing to put some skin in the game.</p>

						<h2>Let us know what you think</h2>
						<p>From a grumble to an eager desire to participate, we'll take it all.  Sure, we'd like the feedback to be helpful, but you can't always choose your path, can you?</p>
						<p>Our biggest goal right now:  Funding.  Our day jobs are distracting, and our health suffers.  We're hoping to leverage the blockchain model for funding our software, because while software is not the heart of things (people are, of course!), it will help us push health into the lives of people on the go, or people who might just be willing to move.</p>
